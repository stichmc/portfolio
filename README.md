## Technologies Used

I built this website using React and Vite, for a modular, efficient, and visually appealing static single page website. HTML5 and Tailwind CSS were employed to structure content and provide styling, and JavaScript enhanced interactivity for a dynamic user experience. The decision to use React and Vite I believe reflects my commitment to modern development practices.
